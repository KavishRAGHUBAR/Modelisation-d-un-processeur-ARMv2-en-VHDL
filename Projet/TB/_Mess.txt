This folder is a mess, so in order to find .vcd files of interest, which can be viewed by GTKWave, it is recommended to choose newer versions of testvX.

Example, choose TestV12 over Testv3. Some are renamed properly and have a pretty explicit name about what the testbench was about.
Eventually, it is possible to load a "test.s" file containing one or more Arm instructions, into the a.out and merge with the testbench to generate a new
tb.vcd.
