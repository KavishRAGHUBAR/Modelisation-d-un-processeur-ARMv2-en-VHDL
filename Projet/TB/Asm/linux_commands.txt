Here will be a list of commands that we use often, it will be useful when downloading the project on different devices

First of all how to generate the a.out out of the test.s / test.asm which is located in the Asm folder :

	arm-linux-gnu-as test.s

next up we need to do a make all from the TB folder and then the makefile will do the job for us :

	make all

finally we need to associate our a.out with the main_tb. we can do so by using this command :

	./main_tb ./Asm/a.out --vcd=testv3.vcd
